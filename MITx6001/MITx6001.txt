syntactic errors: typed errors that the ide usually picks up.

static semantic errors: unpredictable behavior.  For example, program loops indefinitely or program crashes.

No semantic errors but different results than expected given:
Program runs error free.  Miscalculation in formula or algorithm.

4 Types of Scalar Objects:

int : 3,4,1
float: 3.14, .099
bool: true or false
NoneType: Special  and has one value, None

type()

type(3.5)
float

type(4)
int

Expressions:  object operator object
x = 4
3 - 3
"hello" + " world"

Aside from standard operators we also have:
int division i//j
i%j the remainder when I is divided by j
i**j i to the power of j
