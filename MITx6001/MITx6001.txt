syntactic errors: typed errors that the ide usually picks up.

static semantic errors: unpredictable behavior.  For example, program loops indefinitely or program crashes.

No semantic errors but different results than expected given:
Program runs error free.  Miscalculation in formula or algorithm.

4 Types of Scalar Objects:

int : 3,4,1
float: 3.14, .099
bool: true or false
NoneType: Special  and has one value, None

type()

type(3.5)
float

type(4)
int

Expressions:  object operator object
x = 4
3 - 3
"hello" + " world"

Aside from standard operators we also have:
int division i//j
i%j the remainder when I is divided by j
i**j i to the power of j

Week 1: Part II

Swapping values:
x = 1
y = 2
temp = y
y = x
x = temp

Strings:
eric = "My name is Eric"

eric*2
My name is EricMy name is Eric

len(eric)
29

dan = "daniel"

len(dan)
6

dan[1]
a
**Whereas in Java it would be dan.charAt(2);**

dan = "daniel"
dan[1:3]
would print: "an"
dan[:3]
dan
dan[2:]
niel
dan[:]
"daniel" (This is a copy, not the original)


OUTPUT & INPUT:
print()
input()

name = input("Enter your name:")
>>Daniel
name
"Daniel"

*Input automatically creates a String.  To input a integer we must cast it.  For Example:
number = int(input("Enter a number please: "))
